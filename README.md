# Air Quality Overview in New York City

The analysis below provides an overview of air quality in New York in the years 2002 - 2022 based on an open database (link in documentation) using the PowerBI environment.

Due to licensed access to PowerBi web resources for private individuals, the report was published in the form of snapshots.

This dataset allows for the examination of health effects linked to air pollution, organized by geographic regions and time frames. The way the data is grouped enhances its accessibility for analysis and interpretation

## Section I - General Overview of NYC Air Quality
Section I presents the first insight into the problem with air quality (AQ) conditions in New York City. The report's first page describes the variability of the days with particular Air Quality (Bad, Moderate, and Good) over the years. 

The report also included the long-term variability of average AQ in the analyzed period based on the Annual Average, Summer, and Winter periods.

## Section II - Long-term Variability of NYC Air Quality 
Section II focuses on the year-to-year changes in the AQ in NYC overall and in particular seasons (annually, winter, and summer)

The analysis is supported by the calculations of the change in the amount of AQ year by year. Lack of the data in 2014-2017 is due to the lack of annual average values for those years.
