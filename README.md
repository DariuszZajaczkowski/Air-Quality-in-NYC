# Air Quality Overview in New York City

The analysis below provides an overview of air quality in New York in the years 2002 - 2022 based on open database (link in documentation) using the PowerBI environment.

Due to licensed access to PowerBi web resources for private individuals, the report was published in the form of snapshots.

This dataset allows for the examination of health effects linked to air pollution, organized by geographic regions and time frames. The way the data is grouped enhances its accessibility for analysis and interpretation

## Section II - Long-term variablity of NYC Air Quality 
Section II is focusing on the year to year changes in the AQ in NYC overall and in particular seasons (anually, winter and summer)

Analysis is supported by the calculations of the change in the amonut of AQ year by year. Lack of the data in 2014-2017 is due to the lack of annual average values for those years.
